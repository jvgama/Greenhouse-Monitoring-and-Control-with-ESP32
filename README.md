# Greenhouse Monitoring and Control with ESP32
 
The objective of this project is to develop a microcontroller based, low cost greenhouse monitoring and automation system, capable of interacting with the user via mobile or web applications. A performance assessment is carried out through the construction of a prototype combining the appropriate sensors and actuators to the development of specific firmware and software and, finally, different climatic conditions are emulated inside the greenhouse to prove the system's capacity of keeping the conditions within the specified reference values.
